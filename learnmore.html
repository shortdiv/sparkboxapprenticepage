    <h2>What you'll be doing</h2>
    <p>In the first months of your apprenticeship, you'll be exposed to the core technologies of our work and work flow. Everyone, regardless of job title, will be brought to an understanding of Sparkbox's convictions on the priority of content, value of design, semantic HTML, and mobile-first CSS. You'll be exposed to our Github-centric project management, our deployment processes, best practices for clean code and separation of concerns, and unit testing techniques. By the end of your apprenticeship, you'll be interacting as a full-fledged team member. Your confidence will be up, you'll have some work under your belt, and that's when the real fun begins.</p>
    <p>Check out our <a href="#">apprenticeship Github repository</a> to get a really good sense of what you'll be doing.</p>
    <h2>Apply</h2>
    <p>How bad do you want it? What you provide us is very important â€” this is your opportunity to present your case. Choose your answers wisely, my friend!</p>
